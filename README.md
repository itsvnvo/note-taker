### Install

 npm install and then node server.js if you would like to run it as localhost. \
 Otherwise it is uploaded here to heroku: https://boiling-island-49991.herokuapp.com/
 Once you start writing a note and if you dont save before clicking the edit button it will get rid of the currect note you have. \
 You can look at pass notes by clicking on them in the left hand column when they are populated. \
 If you want to delete the note it will be the trash icon in the left hand column.
